This transformation has birthed a distinct stratification system comprising nine social classes, each defined by unique occupational, educational, and financial markers. Understanding the nuances of these strata is essential for grasping the country's current economic dynamics, with particular attention required for the middle class. This demographic has emerged as a pivotal force in consumer markets and social stability, yet it faces unique financial pressures and vulnerabilities that distinguish it from both the elite and the working class.\n\n## Overview of China's Nine Social Classes\n\nChinese sociologists categorize the population into nine distinct social strata based on occupation, education, income, and social status. This hierarchical structure reflects the diverse outcomes of China's economic reforms and the varying degrees of access to capital and political power.\n\nAt the apex of the social hierarchy are **State and Social Institution Managers**. This elite class comprises high-ranking government officials and executives in state-owned enterprises who wield significant political power and enjoy privileged access to resources. Their annual income typically ranges from ¥500,000 to over ¥2,000,000 ($72,000-$290,000+), supported by substantial real estate holdings and diverse investment portfolios [2]. Following them are **Private Entrepreneurs**, individuals who have built substantial enterprises with significant market influence. While their income is highly variable, often ranging from ¥300,000 to millions annually, their wealth is primarily tied to business equity, making them susceptible to policy shifts and market volatility [2].\n\nThe upper-middle stratum includes **Managers in Private Enterprises and Organizations**, who exercise operational authority without owning the enterprises. Earning between ¥200,000 and ¥800,000 annually, they possess university educations and benefit from corporate advancement, though they lack the security of business ownership [2]. Closely related are **Professional and Technical Personnel**, such as doctors, lawyers, and engineers, who form the core of the upper-middle class with incomes ranging from ¥150,000 to ¥600,000. Their status relies heavily on advanced degrees and specialized knowledge, often translating into better educational opportunities for their children [2].\n\n**Clerical Personnel** represent the lower-middle class, performing administrative duties for ¥80,000 to ¥250,000 annually. While they possess job security relative to lower strata, they are vulnerable to automation and organizational restructuring [2]. **Individual Business Owners**, such as shopkeepers and small service providers, operate with high exposure to market conditions, earning ¥60,000 to ¥300,000 annually with their assets tied primarily to business equipment and inventory [2].\n\nThe working class foundation consists of **Commercial and Service Staff**, who earn ¥50,000 to ¥120,000 and often hold limited assets aside from a mortgaged apartment [2]. **Industrial Workers**, including factory and construction laborers, frequently represent rural-to-urban migrants earning ¥40,000 to ¥100,000, with minimal assets and variable social security coverage [2]. Finally, **Agricultural Laborers** constitute the largest traditional class, though it is rapidly shrinking. Located primarily in rural areas, they earn ¥20,000 to ¥50,000 annually, holding land usage rights and basic rural housing [2].\n\n*Table: Summary of Income and Asset Profiles Across China's Nine Social Classes*\n\n| Social Class | Annual Income Range (CNY) | Primary Assets | Key Characteristics |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. State/Social Managers** | ¥500,000 - 2,000,000+ | Multiple properties, investment portfolios | High political power, resource access |\n| **2. Private Entrepreneurs** | ¥300,000 - Millions | Business equity, real estate | High risk, market vulnerability |\n| **3. Private Enterprise Managers** | ¥200,000 - 800,000 | Residence, stock options | University-educated, corporate track |\n| **4. Professional/Technical** | ¥150,000 - 600,000 | One home, financial instruments | Specialized knowledge, human capital |\n| **5. Clerical Personnel** | ¥80,000 - 250,000 | Home (smaller cities) or rental | Administrative roles, moderate security |\n| **6. Individual Business Owners** | ¥60,000 - 300,000 | Business equipment, inventory | Market exposed, small-scale operations |\n| **7. Commercial/Service Staff** | ¥50,000 - 120,000 | Apartment (with mortgage) | Service-oriented, limited benefits |\n| **8. Industrial Workers** | ¥40,000 - 100,000 | Minimal assets (home in lower-tier) | Migrant workers, variable social security |\n| **9. Agricultural Laborers** | ¥20,000 - 50,000 | Land rights, rural housing | Rural base, aging population |\n\n## Defining Characteristics of the Chinese Middle Class\n\nThe Chinese middle class, typically encompassing Classes 3, 4, and 5 (managers, professionals, and clerical personnel), is distinguished by a specific set of socioeconomic markers that separate it from both the affluent elite and the working class. A primary distinguishing feature is educational attainment. Middle-class individuals typically possess post-secondary education, with professionals often holding specialized degrees. This educational background represents a significant intergenerational achievement, marking a departure from the labor-intensive backgrounds of the working class [2].\n\nOccupational stability serves as another critical differentiator. Unlike the precarity often experienced by service staff or industrial workers, middle-class occupations offer relative job security, formal contracts, and benefits such as paid leave. This stability allows for long-term financial planning, a luxury less accessible to lower strata [2]. Furthermore, homeownership is a defining marker. In China, owning at least one residential property is considered a prerequisite for middle-class status. However, this often comes with substantial mortgage burdens, particularly in major urban centers where the cost of entry is high [6].\n\nConsumption patterns further delineate the middle class. They participate in discretionary spending on travel, education, and quality consumer goods, yet they often maintain higher savings rates than their Western counterparts due to a lack of a robust social safety net [5]. This group is also characterized by intense social mobility aspirations. There is a heavy investment in children's education with the explicit expectation of upward movement, creating significant familial pressure [9]. Despite these advantages, the Chinese middle class faces a unique financial vulnerability characterized by anxiety regarding medical costs, education expenses, and housing, which stems from the limitations of current social welfare provisions [2].\n\n## Size and Proportion of the Middle Class\n\nDetermining the precise size of China's middle class is complex due to varying definitions and methodologies, yet recent data provides a clear picture of its substantial growth. Using the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standard—defined as individuals earning between 50% and 150% of the median national income—China's middle class reaches approximately 400 to 500 million people. This represents roughly 28% to 35% of the total population [1], [4].\n\nHowever, when stricter standards are applied—incorporating educational attainment, occupational status, and asset ownership—the estimates contract. Under these rigorous criteria, the middle class comprises approximately 200 to 300 million people, or about 14% to 21% of the population [2]. This disparity highlights the existence of a \"lower middle class\" or \"emerging middle class\" that meets income thresholds but may lack the asset security or educational credentials of the established middle class. Focusing specifically on urban centers, where middle-class attributes are most pronounced, estimates suggest there are 150 to 200 million metropolitan middle-class residents [1].\n\nGeographically, this population is unevenly distributed. Tier 1 cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen are home to approximately 25% to 30% of the middle-class population, despite containing less than 10% of the nation's total people [8]. Tier 2 cities, including Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Wuhan, house another 35% to 40% of the middle class, often offering more favorable housing affordability ratios. The remaining 30% to 35% are scattered across Tier 3 and 4 cities, where characteristics often diverge from the coastal metropolitan models [8].\n\nDemographically, the middle class is concentrated in the 30 to 50 age range, representing households in their peak earning years. Family structures are typically smaller, often with 0 to 2 children, influenced by historical family planning policies and current economic pressures [1]. There are also notable generational gaps; older cohorts who were the first to benefit from the economic reforms often have different spending habits and asset profiles compared to younger generations who face higher housing costs but enjoy greater access to global consumer trends [5].\n\n## Financial Capabilities of the Middle Class\n\nThe financial status of China's middle class is multifaceted, characterized by high asset accumulation in real estate, rising debt levels, and conservative savings habits.\n\n### Income and Asset Holdings\nMiddle-class households typically report an annual income ranging from ¥150,000 to ¥500,000 ($21,750-$72,500). While incomes have grown 7% to 10% annually over the last decade, recent years indicate a slowing of this trajectory [3]. Income structure relies heavily on earned wages, though dual-income households are becoming the standard, and investment returns are playing an increasingly supplementary role. Regional disparities are stark; households in Tier 1 cities earn 30% to 50% more than those in Tier 3 cities but face 60% to 80% higher housing costs [8].\n\nAsset composition reveals a heavy concentration in real estate. Approximately 70% to 80% of middle-class assets are tied up in residential property, a figure far exceeding that of Western economies [6]. Homeownership rates are high, with 85% to 90% of urban middle-class households owning at least one residence. Furthermore, 20% to 25% own a second property, often for investment or for future use by adult children [6]. Vehicle ownership is also prevalent, with 60% to 70% of households owning at least one car. In contrast, financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds comprise only 15% to 25% of total wealth [10].\n\n### Debt and Savings\nDebt accumulation has become a defining feature of middle-class life. The overall debt-to-income ratio has risen dramatically from 30% in 2010 to approximately 90% to 100% in recent years, paralleling levels seen in developed economies [7]. Housing mortgages constitute the bulk of this debt, accounting for 60% to 70% of total liabilities. In major cities, mortgage-to-income ratios frequently sit between 40% and 60%, creating significant monthly cash flow constraints [7]. Consumer debt is also rising, driven by credit card usage, auto loans, and financing for education and consumption.\n\nDespite high debt levels, savings rates remain robust. The middle class saves approximately 20% to 30% of disposable income, a decline from the 35%+ rates seen a decade ago but still high by global standards [10]. This behavior is driven by precautionary motives: 40% to 45% of savings are for retirement security, 25% to 30% for children's education, and 15% to 20% for medical emergencies [10]. Bank deposits remain the primary vehicle for savings, used by 50% to 60% of households, reflecting a risk-averse mindset despite the availability of higher-yield financial products.\n\n### Investment Behaviors\nInvestment practices are evolving but remain conservative. Real estate continues to be the preferred investment class, with 40% to 50% of middle-class families purchasing additional properties as a store of wealth, viewing them as safer than financial markets [6]. Participation in wealth management products offered by banks and tech companies has grown, typically providing returns of 3% to 5% [10]. Stock market participation is volatile, with only 25% to 35% of middle-class individuals holding stocks directly or through funds. International diversification is limited by capital controls, though channels like the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor program are seeing gradual uptake [3].\n\n## Regional Variations in Middle Class Characteristics\n\nThe financial standing and lifestyle of the Chinese middle class are not monolithic; they vary significantly based on geography and urban hierarchy.\n\nCoastal provinces, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Fujian, host a more mature middle class with average incomes 15% to 25% above the national average. These regions benefit from a longer history of economic development, greater exposure to international markets, and higher asset appreciation, though they also contend with elevated housing costs [8]. In contrast, interior provinces like Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan exhibit lower incomes but also lower living costs, resulting in comparable standards of living. The middle class in these regions is emerging rapidly, with housing affordability generally more favorable than on the coast [8].\n\nThe urban hierarchy further stratifies this group. In Tier 1 cities, the middle class is the most affluent but faces the highest housing cost pressure. These residents exhibit the highest education levels and a global orientation in their consumption patterns, yet they struggle with the greatest disparity between income and housing affordability [6]. Tier 2 cities, such as Hangzhou and Chengdu, are attracting migrants with expanding professional opportunities and more balanced housing affordability ratios. These cities are developing their own cultural and lifestyle ecosystems, offering an alternative to the pressure-cooker environment of the top tier [1]. Finally, in Tier 3 and 4 cities, the middle class adheres to more traditional consumption patterns. While they enjoy lower housing costs, they face lower income potential and rely more heavily on traditional family networks for support [8].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nChina's social structure is defined by nine distinct classes, with the middle class serving as the critical pivot point between the elite and the working masses. Comprising roughly 200 to 500 million people depending on the definition, this group is characterized by high educational attainment, occupational stability, and significant asset accumulation, particularly in real estate. However, their financial profile is marked by high leverage, with debt-to-income ratios approaching 100%, and a persistent need for high savings to offset gaps in the social safety net. Regional disparities remain profound, influencing everything from income levels to investment behaviors. As China moves forward, the financial health and stability of this middle class will be paramount in driving domestic consumption and maintaining social cohesion, making their economic behavior a key indicator of the nation's trajectory.\n\n### Sources\n\n[1] China Urban Middle Class Research: National Bureau of Statistics of China (2025 Annual Report on Urban Development):

The publication has been providing leading insights into personal wealth for more than fifteen years. Over time, it’s become the reference point for those interested in the trends shaping wealth across the world. This year’s report covers 56 markets, 471 USD trillion in global wealth and >92% of the world’s wealth. Here are some of our key findings: The world became richer again in 2024 but it's a mixed picture. Wealth growth was tilted strongly towards North America, driven by a stable US dollar and upbeat financial markets. The United States and mainland China jointly account for more than half of the entire personal wealth in our sample. Switzerland and the United States lead in average wealth per adult, followed by Hong Kong SAR and Luxembourg. In median wealth per adult, Luxembourg comes out top, followed by Australia and Belgium. This year’s report highlights EMILLIs – Everyday MILLIonaires – an overlooked but growing wealth category with assets of USD 1–5 million. Our analysis shows the number of EMILLIs in the world has more than quadrupled to around 55 million since 2000. At the end of 2024, they accounted for around USD 61 trillion of total wealth net of inflation – more than double the amount at the end of 2000. A great horizontal wealth transfer is under way. Roughly USD 83 trillion are expected to be passed on within the next 20 to 25 years. Around USD 9 trillion of this wealth transfer will be horizontal, and mostly in the Americas. The world added over 680,000 new USD millionaires in 2024, slightly more than the year before. And we estimate an additional 5.34 million people will become USD millionaires by 2029, an increase of almost 9% over 2024.

"陆学艺：当代中国社会阶层_爱思想\n\n\n\n今天重点讲关于社会结构发展变化的研究问题，重点讲阶层，深入认识分析阶层结构。\n\n中国社会科学院社会学所1998年秋接受研究中国社会结构的任务，当时我任所长，主持了这项工作。在全国十个县市、十二个省市做了深入的调查研究。在此基础上写了两个报告：一是2002年初发表的《当代中国社会阶层的研究报告》，说中国现在已经有十个社会阶层。二是2004年7月出版的《当代中国社会流动》一书。第一本书认为现在已经不是两个阶级一个阶层，已经分化为十个阶层，第二本书内容主要是讲这十个阶层是如何由原来的工人阶级、农民阶级、知识分子阶层演变而来，而且将往哪里变，以及将来阶层结构发展变化的前景等。\n\n首先，社会阶层结构是一个国家、地区的基本国情、基本地情，研究阶层结构本身是研究基本国情，即一个国家、一个地区的经济怎么样，社会怎么样。以前往往从经济结构来说，经济发展情况，人均GDP多少，一二三产业多少，大致比例怎么样，通过这些数字大致知道这个地方的发展水平。其实同样也可以从国家社会阶层结构来判断，比如这个国家的上层阶层、中间阶层、底层的比例，工人阶层、农民阶层有多少，通过对他们的状况分析就可以判断这个国家、地区的基本国情、地情。\n\n第二，由于经济结构的变化，特别是所有制变化，原来单一的公有制发展到现在以公有制为主体的多种所有制成分，特别是20世纪80年代后期至90年代，社会上产生了一些新的阶层，一些社会阶层分化了，有些阶层的社会地位提高，有些社会阶层的地位下降。当今社会阶层结构呈现出向多元化现代化发展的趋势，已经不是原来的“两个阶级一个阶层”的结构。对于这些新情况，由于过去对阶级阶层方面的研究不够，又没有提到应有的认识上，所以现在对社会阶层结构的认识基本上是笼统的。\n\n我们第一本书出来以后，去开了一些调查会，当时福建省福清市的一个办公室主任在会议上说过一段话，我印象很深。他说，实际上要制定正确的政策，就应该对阶级、阶层状况有很详细的研究，这样，才能有针对性。现在没有这方面的研究，就不能有的放矢。一个省有几千万人，到底工人多少，农民多少，科学技术人员多少，干部多少，他们各自的状况怎样？研究的不是太清，所以制定政策就很难落实，往往是事倍功半。\n\n2004年，国家把“三农”工作作为重中之重，而且国家对种植粮食的农民进行现金补贴，这个政策十分正确，花了一百多个亿，而且产生的效果也好，也增产了粮食。但是仔细研究一下，能不能改进得更好一点，效果更好一点？譬如，去年政策下来以后，在不同地方有不同反响。\n\n政策出台以后，我给老家兄弟打了一个电话，说最近农村有一个好政策，你们知道吗？种一亩地可以补贴三十块钱的粮食政策。无锡的农民真正靠农业为生的已经很少，我的弟弟主要靠二三产业的收入来维持家用，只种口粮田，他说家里三口人种一亩多地，是四十来块钱，一亩地不就是一包烟钱吗！所以这种政策对于这样的农民作用不是太大。\n\n不久前，我到黑龙江五大连池农村调查，一南一北差距很大。那里的农民人均有六亩地，我去调查的那户农民，五口人，他告诉我是种两垧地三十亩。一亩补助三十块钱共九百块钱，而且当年黑龙江省还免了农业税，所以一进一出就增加一千八九百块钱，他们对中央支农的政策反应就非常好。\n\n所以我想如果对于农村调查、社会分层的调查比较全面，有区别、有的放矢地对待，可以起到事半功倍的作用。\n\n■当前中国社会阶层结构分为十大层次\n\n如果对于农村调查、社会分层的调查比较全面，有区别、有的放矢地对待，可以起到事半功倍的作用。\n\n现在国内对于社会结构研究的说法，从大的框架来说有这么三种：第一种还是用两个阶级的标准。现在说是演化为两个阶级，若干个阶层。就是工人阶级、农民阶级，私营企业主阶层、经理人员阶层、技术人员阶层等等。第二种是进行阶级分析，这种小范围研究还是有的，把现在中国分成7个阶级、6个阶级的都有，但公开的书和文章不多。第三种主张搞阶层分析，我们就是属于这一观点，认为现阶段，进行社会阶层分析比较好。我们的两本书的观点就是这样。\n\n我们这个课题组就是认为中国的社会结构、中国的人群已经分化为十个阶层。现在划分阶层跟阶级划分不一样。首先现在我国是工业化、市场化的国家，所以以职业分类为基础，接着以组织资源、经济资源、文化资源占有状况为标准。首先要看职业，不同职业的人，经济和社会地位，都是不同的。\n\n根据这个理论框架我们现在把全国7亿多就业人员作一个分析。分析的结果是划分成十个阶层。这里说明一下，这主要是根据全国抽样，抽了12个省市72个县市6000户，这跟统计局做的数据不完全一样，但基本接近。\n\n第一个阶层是国家与社会管理者阶层，是指具有实际行政职权的干部，不是所有的干部，是实际负责的干部，他们占全国就业人数的2.1%，这是2001年的数字。主要是党政机关和事业单位、人民群众团体的负责人员。\n\n第二个阶层是经理人员，包括三个部分，一个是国家公有制企业的老总、经理、中上层的干部，第二部分是三资企业的中上层管理干部，第三部分是现在私营企业的经理人员。他们占全国就业人数的1.6%，这个队伍还在扩大。\n\n第三个阶层是私营企业主阶层，现在私营企业主接近千万户。\n\n第四个阶层叫专业技术人员阶层，包括研究人员、教学人员、工程师、医生、律师、文化工作者或者叫白领，这个队伍比较大，占全国就业人数的4.6%，实际上北京、上海这些大城市都超过10%，但农村、县以下较少。\n\n第五个阶层是办事人员阶层，是跟国家与社会管理者阶层相对应的，包括办公室主任、秘书、会计、出纳，还有电脑工作者、统计人员等等，当时占全国就业人数的7.2%。\n\n第六个阶层是个体工商户阶层。我国把雇工7人以下的称为个体工商户。\n\n第七个阶层是商业服务人员，实际上也是第三产业工人、商业服务人员，但是现代商业、现代服务业人员还很少。现在这个队伍也是在扩大，将来要比第八个阶层大，现在是占11.2%。\n\n第八个阶层是产业工人阶层。制造业、建筑业的操作工人，是体力和半体力劳动者，现在在不少行业里，如纺织、服装、电子、玩具、塑料制品等行业里，第一线工作的已经是以农民工为主，产业工人阶层占21.7%。\n\n第九个阶层是农业劳动者阶层。据2001年的调查，这个队伍占42.9%。这个数字已经够大，现在社会结构不合理主要在这里。\n\n第十个阶层是城乡的失业者和半失业者，统计数字2001年是4.8%，这里讲的是城镇的。\n\n■中国社会阶层结构的总体特点\n\n以职业分类为基础，接着以组织资源、经济资源、文化资源占有状况为标准。不同职业的人，经济和社会地位，都是不同的。\n\n与国际相比，中国现在到底是一个什么样的社会阶层结构？对此，有以下四个方面的认识：\n\n第一，中国已经形成一个现代化社会阶层结构，但还只是一个雏形，而且还正在发展变化之中。首先国际上一些国家的阶级阶层的基本成分，比如技术工人、专业技术人员、经理阶层、企业主阶层我们国家都有了。这些阶层以前很少或者没有，现在都有了。跟国外现代化国家的阶层结构相比，差别在于结构比例还不合理。\n\n其次，十个阶层的排序是已经确定了，排序不是随意搞的，是按照拥有三种资源的多少来排列，不是任意的，而且基本上一个阶层是一个台阶。\n\n我们研究所每年会接待一些外国朋友，他们常常问，农民工这么多，干最苦最累的活，同工又不同酬，时间这么长，待遇这么差，为什么没有闹意见？不能说没有事，但可以说农民工同城里人基本上相安无事。为什么？农民工跟他在老家的农民生活比，经济和社会地位提高了。农民工这个大群体实际是上了第八和第九之间的半个台阶。他在城里能找到一个岗位，能够站住脚的话，他是满意的，他不是跟上面比，而是跟老家的农民比。农民工问题是国家要解决好的大问题，不能长此以往存在的。\n\n第二，现代社会的流动机制正在形成。《当代中国社会流动》一书，讲的是社会的流动。改革开放以后，我国正在由先赋型社会转变为后致型社会，农民可以进城来打工，年轻人通过学习、努力，可以上大学，毕业以后可以当教员、当国家干部，上升了，所以现在是一个开放、有活力的社会。一个现代社会一定是个开放、流动畅通、公正的社会，现在我们已经往这个方向走，正在发展。但是现在的户口制度、有些人事制度、有些社保制度还没有完全改，还不能说已经是完全开放的社会，但是总的来说，社会流动已经畅通了，社会流动机制已经改变了，现代社会结构包括现代社会的流动机制正在形成。\n\n第三，现阶段中国的社会阶层结构是在经济体制改革、经济发展和社会体制改革滞后的背景下，自然、自发形成的，还不合理，还在发展变化中，与社会主义现代化建设还不适应。\n\n现在的阶层结构还不合理，不合理主要表现有两点，一是该大的社会阶层没有大起来，二是该小的没有小下去。按照现在的经济水平，正常的话，社会中间阶层（国外叫中产阶级）的规模要比现在的大。该小的没有小下去指的是农民，现在已经到社会工业化中期阶段，已经变成制造业大国，但是农民在户口上还占70%，从业劳动力还占50%，而每年创造的GDP就占14.6%。\n\n社会中间阶层从阶层分析方面来说，首先是个职业概念。其次所谓中间阶层不是一个阶层，在十个阶层里面，前六个阶层里面有很大部分都是中间阶层，是若干个阶层的总称。\n\n如果按照现在经济发展的速度持续发展，如果社会流动是开放的，社会政策能够到位，中间阶层到2020年应该接近40%，社会要比现在稳定得多。\n\n第四，一个国家要形成一个合理的有活力的社会阶层结构，不仅要靠国家的经济结构调整、经济发展的带动，靠“无形的手”的推动使之自然地演变和成长，还要靠国家在适当的时机采取适当的社会政策，也就是还要靠“有形的手”加以调控和引导。\n\n■中国社会阶层结构演变的前景分析\n\n按照现在的经济水平，正常的话，社会中间阶层（国外叫中产阶级）的规模要比现在的大。该小的没有小下去指的是农民。\n\n首先，从国际的经验来看，现在正处于一个战略机遇期，国际国内的形势都好。第二，处于一个发展的关键时期。国家领导人反复讲，如果搞得好，就能够顺利进入中等发展国家，如果搞不好，或者严重失误，就可能出现社会停滞、甚至倒退。对这一点应该有明确的认识。国际上做过一个研究，现在190多个国家和地区，真正搞成发达国家、现代国家、比较稳定的国家不超过30个。不是搞了市场经济都能进入现代化的，现在只是西欧一片，北欧有一些，然后就是北美、日本、韩国、新加坡和我国的香港、台湾地区，能够说得上已经进入现代化发达国家和地区的不超过30个。\n\n为什么说中国的改革和发展到了关键时期？20世纪六七十年代亚洲的“四小龙”和拉丁美洲发展得都很快。“四小龙”的经济、社会政策正确，人均GDP很快越过3000美元，达到7000美元，甚至到了1万美元，新加坡更多，而且社会比较稳定、和谐。但是紧跟着美国走的拉丁美洲国家，有的经济甚至上到人均5000、6000美元，但是社会结构没有变，产业政策也不对，所以一有风吹草动，一个金融危机，经济就崩溃了。有一段时间把拉美的经验吹得很重，后来不行了。它的原因，从社会学的角度看，就是经济发展一度上去了，但社会结构没有调整。\n\n我们现在遇到的一个问题是，要全面建设小康社会，构建和谐社会，总体看来，在经济上已经有经验，发展速度保持在7%、8%，2020年达到3000美元，已经问题不大。但是比较难的是社会的改革和发展，如果社会体制方面不改革、社会建设上不去，社会结构改不过来，该大的大不起来，该小的小不下去，农民还是占总人口的60%、70%，那肯定无法实现现代化。\n\n所以在《当代中国社会流动》这本书的前言部分，预测中国社会阶层结构变化的前景有三个，一是按照科学发展观统领经济社会的发展，统领构建和谐社会，真正这么办了，进行社会方面的改革和建设，社会结构的调整，形成该大的大起来，该小的小下去，形成中产阶层比较大的一个社会结构，建立一个现代化的、公正公平的、有活力的、开放的、和谐的社会阶层结构，这样现代化就实现了。\n\n二是如果改革下不去，那么即使经济上达到3000美元，社会结构还是这样，拉丁美洲的前车之鉴就摆在那里，因为一个现代社会一定是一个两头小、中间大的社会。从收入结构说也是这样，不能像现在富的都富到这样程度，穷的穷成这样，一些社会政策就是出不来。比如累进所得税、遗产税、财产税就是出不来，户口制度就是改不了，农民工的制度就是改不了。发展下去，社会结构保持现在这样，底层比较大，上面比较小，还是保持洋葱形状，到不了橄榄型。\n\n三是我国的发展遇到阻碍。现在看，我们的发展遇到了一个大好的机遇期。但是同时要看到，一些超级大国不希望我们强大。如塔里木油的成本当年是2.2美元一桶，而国际油价已卖到56美元一桶，有人在操纵国际油价。另外，今年铁矿砂一下涨了71%，有人在算计我们。所以国际局势不是大好，国际环境有恶劣的一面，如果上述国内这些问题解决不了，就可能出问题，像拉丁美洲那样，社会结构就可能从现在的洋葱型变成烛台型。中下层变得越来越大，中间阶层可能反而缩小。\n\n中央十六大以后，党中央提出科学发展观，提出构建和谐社会，这是一个大的转变，是一个大的战略决策。如果按照这个去做，我想会逐步地解决上述问题，所以下面的预测比较乐观。\n\n■设想中的五个变化\n\n如果社会体制方面不改革、社会建设上不去，社会结构改不过来，农民还是占总人口的60%、70%，那肯定无法实现现代化。\n\n西部城市跟南方的城市差别并不大，但当地的城乡差别超过全国的平均水平，所以那里的农村跟东部的农村不能相比。\n\n我们设想，如果今后继续深化改革，继续按照中央的部署去做，今后15到20年可能发生以下变化：\n\n一、城市化的步伐会加快，改变现在城市化滞后于工业化的状态。2003年的城市化率是40.5%，今后每年能够提高一个百分点，到2020年城市化率能够达到55%-60%。\n\n二、调整产业结构与就业结构的关系。举例说，2003年的经济结构中第一产业占14.6%，但是就业的劳动力占49.1%，差35个百分点，这是农民收入低的根本原因。如果今后第一产业的劳力能够平均每年减少1-1.2个百分点，使农业劳动力降到30%左右，我想这个社会结构方面该小下去的就有可能小下去。三农问题根本点是解决农民问题，现在有关方面只注意解决农业问题，但是现在这么多农民的问题却不重视，这是不行的。三农问题的核心要解决农民问题，世界上都是这样。\n\n三、城乡差别、地区差别会逐步缩小。地区差距实际上也是城乡差别表现的一个方面。\n\n现在我们到西部的城市去，可以感到它们跟南方的城市差别并不大，但当地的城乡差别超过全国的平均水平，所以那里的农村跟东部的农村不能相比，要缩小这一差距。\n\n2003年农村居民与城市居民平均每人年收入比例是1：3.23，如果再加上城市居民的隐性收入，则比例约为1：5.6，这是社会不稳定的主要原因。据国际经验，大致是农民收入100，城市居民收入150，1：1.5比较合理，像日本是1：1，我们这样是不行的。缩小城乡居民收入差距这个问题十六大就提出来，但是这几年没有缩小，而且在加大。这是体制问题，不从体制上改解决不了。如果改革了，能每年缩小0.1-0.2个百分点，缩小到1：1.5-1：2之间，就合理了。\n\n四、贫富差距逐步缩小。1978年，我国的基尼系数为0.22，这几年急剧拉大，现在为0.458。在0.4以内是正常的，0.2以下是平均主义。所以要制定新的政策，每年能降一点，要降到0.4以下。\n\n五、社会中间阶层的规模扩大。中间阶层2004年约占全社会的20%，今后每年能扩大一个百分点，到2020年，达到38%左右，如果能达到40%，就进入现代化社会。有了这样一个社会阶层结构，国家社会就可以比较稳定。\n\n本文责编：jiangxl\n\n

说说法律。\n\n毫无疑问，法律是为统治阶层服务的，具体的说就是为1—3服务，这个服务的边缘就是第4级以及5级中的体制内，法律的鸿沟在4-5之间。当不涉及1-4级时，法律是相对公正的，也受到舆论较大的影响——具体参见吴虹飞案。特别要强调的是，在4级以上特别是1-3级的纠纷，都不会通过法律解决——因为上层都明白，那玩意就是骗4级以下的老百姓。上层的纠纷是实力对比喝讲茶，这个层面讲法律传出去是要被笑话的。\n\n至于所有P民们寄予厚望的改革，公报大家都可以看，就是继续小心地骑自行车，绝对没有赶紧换成汽车的意思。如果有什么病，吃点药是必须的，但最好是不打针，至于做手术，那就别想了。\n\n因为1-3要的是维稳，4级改革的欲望也很低。5-6阶层是创业和改革热情最高的阶层，但绝对没有话语权。\n\n知道GDP为什么要保8吗？保增长保就业，真正的原因是要保证第8级的人群不能掉进第9级。哈哈。现在这个目标调整为7.5——意思就是至少要保证8级中有一半的人不掉进9。至于底限是7，意思是如果保不住8级，也不允许7级掉入9。\n\n说到底，最受关注的还是7-8啊，如果真有啥大动作，估计也就是4-6级买单。\n\n下面谈谈各个阶层复杂的心态。\n\n1-3无疑是最大的既得利益者，这个阶层另一个特点就是利益可以世袭——只要社会保持稳定，他们的子子孙孙就可以稳定的待在这个阶层继续成为最大的既得利益者。所以，这个阶层最讨厌变化，最喜欢的就是稳定。所以，即使在体制内，政绩什么的都可以排在后面——维稳才是真正的一票否决。在这个意义上至上而下真正的改革出现的可能性很小，除非有一个政治人物同时具备2点特征：第一，他能超越自己与家族的利益；第二，他能找到同类的伙伴能冲破强大的既得利益者束缚。在和平时期，我对出现这样的人物几乎不抱任何希望，在动荡时期出现这样的人物倒有可能，但是更大的可能就是他是一个极右的野心家——这对整个民族几乎是最差的选项。\n\n4级改革的欲望很低——如果不是没有的话。因为他们本身也是既得利益阶层，而且与上层也有千丝万缕的联系。更重要的是，他们能够成为4级也与这些“千丝万缕的联系”脱不了干系。他们关心宏观政策的走向，但是他们更相信体制朋友给的内幕消息。从整个阶层而言，他们是比较稳定而且安全的——前提是没有成为同级体制内或者更高阶层的对立面，否则他们掌握的财富就成了别人眼中的最丰盛的蛋糕。典型的例子参考曾远志案件。在复杂的政治斗争中，这个阶层的体制外部分人最容易成为牺牲品——与权力结合固然是发财的捷径，但同时也怀抱炸弹。所以，这个阶层的人士一般在政治上都非常谨慎——在商言商，不谈政治——比较典型的例子如马云、柳传志。在这个意义上，王石、任志强才是令人钦佩的。基于上述原因，这个阶层的人是最没安全感的，所以，也是移民比例最高的人群。\n\n5-6阶层是创业热情最高的阶层。他们没有与上层“千丝万缕的联系”，只有靠分析宏观形势与政策来寻找机遇。他们想打破天花板所以也有很强的改革愿望。但是现实的犬儒主义使这些阶层大多数人选择观望——顶多是在言论上呼吁。他们一方面羡慕4级以上阶层的生活，另一方面在更低阶层中找到优越感，这种复杂的情绪让这些阶层的人群充斥着一种浮躁的心态。需要强调的是律师这个人群，4、5、6阶层都有，但是改革的欲望更强烈甚至是第一个真正意义上能行动起来的人群。其更本的原因就在于，只有改革至少是司法独立，律师才能获得更大的发展——在司法不公正或者腐败的的情况下，律师生存的空间只会越来越狭窄。所以律师为社会公正、司法公正的呼吁与行动更大意义上是为自己的命运做抗争。\n\n7-8阶层是最没有希望的阶层。他们没有上升的空间，没有人脉、积蓄很少甚至没有。他们可能一辈子都在为一套房子在奋斗。他们不关心宏观经济形势与政策——因为这些与他们无关。即使有个什么机遇，他们也没有任何资源（人脉、资金）来把握这个机遇。最不公平的是——他们几乎没有任何福利来保障自己的基本生活。他们没有安全感——事实上每当经济低迷或者恶化，他们有很大一部分将跌到最悲惨的9级。他们渴望一夜暴富——买彩票是少数可能实现他们这个愿望的途径——另一个途径就是绑大款，做二奶（比如美美同学）。在一个惟利是图的世俗社会为了财富与利益他们大多数人可以毫不犹豫的付出自己的一切——人格、尊严。他们渴望改变很多人甚至在祈求动乱——这2个阶层充满着一股暴戾之气。\n\n9级是这个社会最悲惨的阶层。在全球还没有几个国家象这里直接将一个阶层作为弃子。权贵们可以慷慨的对外拿出大笔援助，却舍不得给予这个阶层一个铜板。这个阶层没有任何福利，收入很低甚至为0，如果在城市只能啃老，在农村只能苟延残喘。这个阶层是最不安分的阶层，如果说7—8两个阶层充满着一股暴戾之气，那么9就是直接铤而走险——80%以上的刑事案件的罪犯都来自这个阶层。\n\n偶然看到学者资中筠女士的一段话：“一百年了，没有长进，上面还是慈禧，下面还是义和团。”这段平实的话，却说明了中国社会转型（核心是社会阶层结构转型）的失败。所谓“失败”，是指中国社会阶层当中，底层数量过于庞大，中产阶级人数占总人口比例偏少。\n\n所谓“上面是慈禧”，大家都明白指的是政治变迁中的核心部分，即政治体制至今未发生质的变化，当权者仍然迷信政治暴力，再加上慈禧当时未曾建立的[思想控制](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/space/%E6%80%9D%E6%83%B3%E6%8E%A7%E5%88%B6)体系。“下面是义和团”，表面上看，是指毛左及社会底层日益显化的暴力倾向。但由于这种暴力倾向源自社会成员的失败感，源于占人口至少60%左右的中国人未能搭上盛世列车，成为社会等级金字塔底座的一部分。",

1.1 收入与资产的结构性矛盾\n\n尽管中产标准设定清晰，但现实数据凸显了严峻挑战：\n\n- 收入差距：全国城镇家庭年收入中位数仅为14.8万元，仅为中产收入门槛的42.3%。即使在北京等一线城市，家庭收入中位数（25.7万元）也仅达标准的73.4%。\n\n- 房产依赖困境：达标家庭净资产中房产占比高达76.2%，而金融资产比例过低（未达标家庭仅13.5%），导致资产流动性差。例如二线城市一套市价200万元的90平米房产，若缺乏其他流动资产，家庭实际抗风险能力仍然脆弱。\n\n- 负债压力：全国居民房贷总额已突破39万亿元，95%购房家庭依赖贷款。高负债率使许多“账面中产”的可支配收入大幅缩水。\n\n### 1.2 教育与职业的隐形壁垒\n\n教育水平和职业稳定性构成中产身份的深层门槛：\n\n- 学历鸿沟：全国25-64岁人口中本科及以上学历者仅占15.8%，北京、上海超40%，而中西部省份普遍低于10%。这使得中西部农村家庭几乎被排除在中产竞争之外。\n\n- 职业分化：金融（27.6%）、IT（23.8%）、医疗（19.2%）行业从业人员达标率高，而传统制造业（8.3%）和服务业（5.7%）则显著偏低。全国2.3亿灵活就业者因收入波动大，即便月入过万也难以达标。\n\n### 1.3 地域与代际分布失衡\n\n中产格局呈现“三重集中”特征：\n\n- 地域集中：京津冀、长三角、粤港澳三大经济圈聚集了64.7% 的中产家庭，其中北上广深四城独占31.5%，而西部12省区总量仅占12.3%。\n\n- 年龄集中：35-55岁群体占中产家庭的67.3%，35岁以下青年家庭因积累不足，达标率仅12.7%。\n\n- 增长动态：2010年至今中产家庭数量从870万户增至3320万户，年均增速6.4%，但仍显著低于OECD国家35%-55%的中产占比（美国38.2%，德国52.3%）。\n\n表：中国中产阶级四项核心达标标准与现实对比\n\n| 指标类型 | 标准要求 | 全国平均水平 | 达标难度指数 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 年收入 | ≥35万元 | 城镇家庭中位数14.8万元 | 仅42.3%达标率 |\n| 净资产 | ≥300万元 | 城镇家庭中位数178万元 | 仅59.3%达标率 |\n| 教育水平 | 本科及以上 | 25-64岁人口占比15.8% | 地域差异巨大 |\n| 收入稳定性 | 可持续职业 | 2.3亿灵活就业者 | 稳定性普遍不足 |\n\n### 2 工薪阶层与底层劳动者：规模庞大的基础阶层\n\n### 2.1 低薪与普薪群体的生存现状\n\n工资分层研究显示，全国87% 的职工处于低薪（月收入<3000元）和普薪（月收入3000-7000元）阶层，构成中国劳动力的主体：\n\n- 低薪阶层（约29%从业人员）：主要集中在制造业流水线（月薪4500-6000元）、偏远地区服务业岗位。典型如长三角电子厂普工，十年薪资涨幅仅35%，远低于物价增速。34岁成制造业“年龄红线”，40岁以上工人占比不足17%。\n\n- 普薪阶层（约58%从业人员）：涵盖基层文员、销售、外卖骑手等职业。外卖员需日均配送12小时、月跑单1500单才能维持生计，电动车更换频率达每8个月1辆。网约车司机王师傅（北京）月流水1.2万元，扣除平台抽成和油费后净收入仅5800元。\n\n### 2.2 技术变革下的就业冲击\n\n自动化与人工智能正加速重塑劳动力市场：\n\n- 东莞某手机配件厂引入AI质检系统后，300人QC团队裁减至52人，转岗成功率不足30%。\n\n- 直播行业看似繁荣，但腰部主播月均工作超280小时，行业淘汰率高达74%，折射出新业态的高强度与不稳定本质。\n\n2.3 城乡二元结构中的农民与农民工\n\n城乡差异呈现“距离衰减”规律：离大城市较近的农村通过土地股份化、集体财产股权化实现富裕，而边远农村则持续滞后。农民工总量达2.9亿人，其中：\n\n- 制造业工人面临“十年工资增长35%”的收入停滞\n\n- 建筑工人归属“小康层”但缺乏稳定性保障\n\n- 快递员等新业态从业者超1000万人，较2018年增长233%\n\n### 3 财富分配顶层：新富阶层与财富垄断群体\n\n### 3.1 新富阶层的资产配置战略\n\n家庭净资产500万至1亿的群体约800万人，形成独特的财富管理逻辑：\n\n- 资产“三三制”配置：深圳私募数据显示，高净值客户采用30%海外资产+30%不动产+30%金融产品的分散策略。\n\n- 消费升级特征：海南免税店年销售额突破1200亿元，百万级腕表成交额增长89%，反映奢侈品消费向“投资型购买”转变。\n\n- 代际传承焦虑：83%的创一代担忧子女守业能力，45%已启动“接班人计划”。杭州企业家的直言：“报马术课不如教看懂财报”凸显实用主义取向。\n\n### 3.2 富豪阶层的资本集中\n\n金字塔尖的0.61% 人群（年收入>100万元）掌握核心生产要素：\n\n- 千亿级富豪约30人，百亿级300人，资产过亿者5万人\n\n- 财富来源超越工资依赖，主要通过股权、投资组合实现增值\n\n- 居住、教育、社交完全“离岸化”，子女海外留学率达92%\n\n*表：中国财富阶层划分与关键特征*\n\n| 阶层类别 | 判定标准 | 人口占比 | 核心特征 | 资产配置偏好 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 富豪阶层 | 资产过亿 | 0.01% | 资本运作主导 | 跨国资产、私募股权 |\n| 新富阶层 | 净资产500万-1亿 | 1.56% | 企业主/高管 | 海外资产、商业保险 |\n| 中间层 | 年收入30-50万 | 6.70% | 专业技能精英 | 基金、房产投资 |\n| 小康层 | 年收入10-30万 | 29.88% | 体制内为主 | 储蓄、公积金购房 |\n| 大众层 | 年收入<10万 | 61.25% | 体力劳动者 | 基本无配置能力 |\n\n### 4 社会结构的整体变迁与发展趋势\n\n### 4.1 从“倒丁字型”向“土字型”转型\n\n清华大学李强教授研究指出，中国社会结构已由21世纪初的“倒丁字型”（底层庞大）转变为“土字型”，中下层占比仍然较大，但中产阶层已上升至总人口的26%-28%（约3亿人）。这一转变源于：\n\n- 城镇化率逆转：2001年农村人口占62.3%，2023年城镇人口占比达63.89%，带来生产方式、生活方式、权利结构的根本性变革。\n\n- 职业结构多元化：快递员（1000万）、网约司机（3000万）、网销人员等新职业群体爆发式增长，兼职化、灵活化成为显著特征。\n\n### 4.2 教育流动与阶层固化博弈\n\n教育仍是阶层跃升主渠道，但效果正在弱化：\n\n- 回报率优势：本科学历者收入比高中学历者高73%，硕士、博士分别再增51%和42%。\n\n- 机会收缩：985高校农村生源比例从2010年的32%降至2024年的19%，上海重点中学国际部学费25万/年，相当于普通工人四年总收入。\n\n- 代际传递强化：深圳学区房交易链展示“70后企业家→80后中介→90后程序员→00后继承者”的财富转移通道。\n\n### 4.3 区域分化与城市层级壁垒\n\n城市层级间职业地位差异显著：\n\n- 超大城市与中小城市的专业岗位比例差距达3：1，导致“大学生难返乡就业”的结构性矛盾。\n\n- 成都、西安等新一线城市通过人才政策，五年内中产家庭比例提升9.2%，成为区域流动新支点。\n\n### 5 政策路径与未来展望\n\n### 5.1 扩大中等收入群体的国家战略\n\n国务院《关于扩大中等收入群体规模的实施意见》设定明确目标：2035年将中产比例提升至35% 以上。实现路径包括：\n\n- 人力资本升级：人工智能、生物医药等领域人才收入比传统行业高85%-120%，需强化职业教育与技能重塑。\n\n-

以疫情和国际局势变化为分界点，全球经济充满变数，房地产行业不景气与科技革新加速进一步推高不确定性。 * 尽管目前高净值群体总量较2022年峰值有所降低，但其总量依然不可忽视，未来10年、20年及30年分别有20万亿、45万亿和79万亿的财富继承潜力。 #### 高净值人群消费规模与趋势 * 2024年，高净值人群消费总体规模达661.63万亿元人民币，其中豪华汽车、传统奢品、烟酒茶、消费电子、服务、酒店旅游等领域的消费规模显著。 * 2024年营收增幅与净利润增幅方面，保健品和服务行业表现突出，分别增长13%和7%，而传统奢品、烟酒茶等受经济不确定性影响较大，净利润增幅分别为-2%、-17%和-12%。 #### 消费行为分析 * 顶奢通过锁定“超高端”消费层巩固护城河，强化稀缺性，为独享感买单，对不可复制价值体验的追逐成为消费核心。 * 大众品类亟待在性价比与情感价值间找到新平衡点。 * 高净值人群消费隐形区隔明显，消费行为呈现稳步升级趋势，尤其在健康、旅行、美食、文化体验等领域。 #### 重点消费领域分析 * **健康消费**：生育、养老、抗衰、心理、体检、医美等领域的消费需求旺盛，其中生育护理、养老社区、抗衰免疫细胞疗程等消费金额较高。 * **旅行消费**：偏好短途野奢度假、豪华度假村、温泉SPA、酒庄体验等，文化体验和美食探索需求显著。 #### 研究结论 * 高净值人群消费行为受经济不确定性影响，但消费升级趋势明显，尤其在健康、旅行、文化体验等领域。 * 消费隐形区隔策略成为重要趋势，品牌需在稀缺性、情感价值和性价比间找到平衡点。](https://www.fxbaogao.com/view?id=4935752)\n\n[查看更多](https://www.fxbaogao.com/view?id=4935752)\n\n![Image 3:

Wealth Report 2024）。这是胡润研究院连续第16年发布此报告。报告揭示了目前中国财富家庭的数量、地域分布和人群画像。报告公布了中国拥有600万人民币、千万人民币、亿元人民币及3000万美元以上总财富的家庭数量，以及相应的可投资资产家庭数量。此次报告涵盖了包括港澳台地区在内的中国34个省级行政区共计108个城市，旨在全面揭示中国财富家庭的规模和分布变化。\n\n 胡润百富董事长兼首席调研官胡润表示：“近年来，全球主要国家的私人财富格局经历了复杂的变化。2022年，全球超高净值人士的财富总量缩水10%，其中欧美平均下降超过10%，中国高净值家庭数量15年来第二次减少，总财富下降3.6%。然而，2023年全球部分国家私人财富开始复苏，尤其是北美地区，这得益于股市反弹、通胀缓解和科技行业推动。相比之下，亚太地区财富恢复较慢，主要受中国股市低迷和房地产市场困境的影响。”\n\n “在地域分布方面，2023年中国共有10个省和直辖市的富裕家庭（资产超过600万）数量超过10万户，包括江苏、浙江、上海、沿海的广东、福建和山东，以及西部的四川，还有北京、香港和台湾。这些地区的富裕家庭总数占全国总数的84%。”\n\n “在城市层面，富裕家庭分布呈现出‘3+4+3’的格局。北京、上海和香港位居前三，富裕家庭数量均超过50万户。其次是深圳、广州、杭州和宁波，这四个城市各有超过10万户富裕家庭。佛山、台北和天津位列第三梯队，富裕家庭数量均在5万户以上。”\n\n “中国600万资产的富裕家庭总财富达到150万亿元，其中，资产超过亿元人民币的超高净值家庭财富总额高达87万亿元，占总财富的58%，相比去年的56%有所上升。”\n\n “中国正迎来财富传承的浪潮。未来10年，预计将有20万亿元财富转移到下一代手中；20年内，这一数字将增至45万亿元；而30年内，财富传承总额将达到79万亿元。”\n\n

不动产 配置比例可能已经见顶。**\n\n目前中国房价涨势趋缓、加杠杆趋难，可能将降低不动产的吸引力。中金公司研究部基于人口年龄结构做的估算显示，预测未来五年居民资产中不动产占比可能降低10个百分点左右。\n\n![Image 3: A doughnut chart showing non-financial assets (58% in 2025E, 68% in 2019), cash and

Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development）所使用之中产阶级定义，它是指家庭人均收入介于全体人口人均收入中位数的75%至200%的这个社会群体。\n\n这里需要解释一下统计学当中的专用术语中位数，它与平均值不同。用一个形象的比喻，中学生的全班平均身高，是每人身高的平均值；而如果全班排队，从低到高，中间那个人的身高，就是全班身高的中位数。\n\n如果用一个两维数轴来表示收入分布，横轴显示收入数，纵轴显示不同收入群体的百分比，当一个国家的收入分配属于典型的正态分布时，则这样的收入分布呈现两端小中间大的钟型曲线，收入中位数会靠近收入平均值，或在平均值的左侧，或在右侧。\n\n然而，如果收入分布的特征是，低收入家庭比重很大，那这样的收入分布曲线就属于偏态分布，即左侧高右侧低，右端呈现一个长尾；这时，全社会的收入平均值会受少数高收入者的影响而被拉高，因此就高于中位数。这便是为什么国际上不采用收入的总体平均值来判断中产阶层的范围，而是改用中位数。\n\n本文第二节已详细介绍了国家发改委2021年中国收入分配报告中披露的不同收入群体的群组比例，据此加权估计，中国2021年的人均月收入平均值大约是1,984元，而中位数则估计是1,200元。如果按照关于中产阶层范围的国际通用标准，就会出现一个令中国人啼笑皆非的结果。\n\n此结果如下，以国家发改委2021年中国收入分配报告中的数据估算，中国的中产阶层之收入下限（即中位数1,200元的75%），大约是人均月收入900元；而中产阶层之收入上界（即中位数1,200元的200%），大约为2,400元。中国人均月收入在900元和2,400元之间的家庭，能算是中产阶层吗？绝大多数中国的城市居民都会摇头，因为，即便按照中国的官方标准，如此收入水准的家庭也只能算是低收入家庭。\n\n今年中国政府颁布的月最低工资是2,400元，假如这个标准得到落实，那中国的收入分布中位数就应该远远大于最低工资。如果一个三口之家之两个大人都只有最低工资，那么，这个家庭的人均月收入是1,600元，显然大大高于全国收入中位数1,200元。\n\n到底是怎么回事？答案很简单。首先，中国政府颁布的月最低工资2,400元，只是个“面子货”，许多人的实际工资远低于这个数额；其次，中国并非一个正常国家，现在还有几乎一半人属于赤贫人口，赤贫人口加上低收入人口，占中国总人口的84%。\n\n尽管中共当局早就宣布，中国已经“崛起”，而且在世界上的地位是“东升西降”，但国家发改委的这份收入分配报告还是揭了老底。由此看来，中国经济衰退，消费疲软，其实不过是因为民众太穷而已，他们没钱，又如何买房买车？\n\n**四、中产阶层不足7%？**\n\n到底中国有多少真的中产阶层？中国人当然都很想知道答案。既然中产阶层的国际通用标准不适用于中国，那就只能看赤贫人口和低收入人口之外的那16%的人口当中，有多少人算是中产阶层了。\n\n前文已提到，这16%的人口，一共是2.2亿人，其中11%的人之月收入是3千到5千元，这组人群约1.54亿人；剩下的5%，约7千万人，大约属于中国的富裕阶层。\n\n因此，要找中国的中产阶层，只能找这11%的人了。其实，这11%的人当中，人均月收入刚到3千元的，属于日子过得很紧的家庭。如果把这部分人剔除，只算人均月收入达到4千至5千元的家庭，那么，按11%人口当中3千、4千、5千人均月收入的群组各占三分之一估计，则4千到5千人均月收入的家庭，大约占这11%人口的三分之二，相当于全国人口的7%，约1亿人。\n\n如此算来，按照“中国特色”的低标准来划分“中产阶层”，中国的所谓“中产阶层”充其量最多不超过总人口的7%，只有1亿人而已。由此可见，所谓的“中产阶层崛起”，在中国不过是一个与“房地产只涨不跌”一样的幻觉。戳破“中产阶层崛起”这个“中产阶层泡沫”之后，中国的“中产阶层”的确只是“薄薄的一层”。\n\n中国的“中产阶层”不但人数有限，财力也有限。如果把中国的“中产阶层”之人均月收入全都按5千元高估，然后与台湾的民众来对比，新台币与人民币的汇率是4.4比1，在中国人均月收入5千元的“中产阶层”，就相当于台湾的人均月收入新台币2万2千元。而台湾现在的最低工资是27,470元新台币，一个三口之家，如果成年人都拿最低工资，这样的家庭之人均月收入是新台币18,300元。这样一对比，中国当下的“中产阶层”当中，收入较好的家庭不过相当于台湾领取最低保障工资的水准。\n\n**五、中台中产两对比，台湾中产多七倍**\n\n中华民国国立政治大学2022年发表了一份报告，《台湾中产阶级所得变动趋势之研究》。 这份报告介绍，研究人员使用主计总处的家庭收支调查、财政部的财税资料库之行政资料和劳动部的劳工保险资料库，分析了台湾2004年到2020年中产阶级之家户或人口占比与所得变化。这个报告的研究者采用国际上通用之中产阶级定义，即家户或个人所得介于全体所得中位数的75%至200%者。\n\n那台湾的中产阶级大约有多少人呢？在2004–2020年间，家庭收支调查的结果是，中产阶级家庭的比重大约是55%；中产阶级之总所得(可支配所得)占全体的比例，从2004年的60.1%-61.7%，成长到2020年的66.6%-67.47%，其中以劳务所得为主；随着所得的提高，中产阶级的劳务所得占比会减少，取而代之的是营利与股利所得、利息所得与其他所得。\n\n上文提到，中国的“中产阶层”中收入较好的家庭，收入大约相当于台湾领取最低保障工资的家庭之收入水准。收入相差这么多，那是不是中国的物价比台湾低很多，因此中国中产家庭的实际购买力更强呢？其实，中国沿海大城市的物价和台湾差不多；但中国内地城镇和乡村的物价，会比台湾低一点。\n\n如果对比中国和台湾中产阶层的比重，中国的“中产阶层”相当于全国人口的7%，而台湾的中产阶层相当于总人口的55%。也就是说，台湾的中产阶层百分比，是中国“中产阶层”百分比的8倍；或者说，台湾的中产阶层比重，比中国多7倍。\n\n**六、户均背债一百万，中产返贫变“中惨”**\n\n中国从加入世贸组织开始，花了20多年时间，用泡沫经济养成了占人口不到7%的“中产”家庭。现在很多中国很多人希望，房价能够重新涨上去，而不是持续下跌；否则，自己买的房子就可能变成负资产了。\n\n本文分析中国家庭收入令人吃惊的真相，除了要找出中国的“中产阶层”到底有多少人，还想知道，究竟中国的房价还有没有可能重新翻高？\n\n房价要能涨得上去，前提是，今后还有很多人能买房。哪一个社会群体有能力再买房呢？赤贫户和中低收入户显然是不可能的。唯一可能再买更多房子的群体，就只能是这1亿“中产阶层”了。按一家三口计，“中产”家庭不过3千万户。他们会不会再买房，取决于“中产”家庭现在有没有房，还能不能有余钱再买房？\n\n要看中国的“中产”家庭现在有没有房，有一个银行数据很靠谱，那就是居民的房地产贷款。凡是买了房的“中产”家庭，多半都有房贷，中国现在所有银行的房贷余额，到今年3月底一共是48兆。其中还有富人炒房借的房贷，富人一般都有几套房，我按富人的房贷占全部房贷的四分之一来估计，那剩下的房贷就是“中产阶层”的房贷债务了。\n\n这样来估算，中国的“中产阶层”现有的房贷债务至少有36兆，户均背负120万房贷。从还款期限来看，如果中产家庭人均月收入5千元，每户平均月收入1万5千元，以差不多二分之一的收入用于还贷，每月最大的还贷能力是7千元，一年还款8万4，现有的家庭平均房贷债务需要再还14年。从现在起，中国的中产家庭即便不失业、不降薪，他们在14年内都不可能再买房了。\n\n中国以这么少的“中产阶层”人口和这么低的收入水平，却要他们支付买房的高房价，那么，“中产家庭”就只能大量借债。因此可以看出，中国经济现在的衰退，实际上是债务经济引发经济泡沫化；一旦泡沫经济破灭，不但经济长期衰退，而且“中产阶级”的数量会不断缩小、收入下降，也就是所谓的“去中产阶级化”。\n\n现在中共的经济政策是，尽量限制房价下跌，否则银行的抵押资产大缩水，就可能面临银行破产带来的金融危机。但是，二手房市场的成交价是买卖双方自己谈成的，政府控制不了，按现在的房价下跌趋势再持续两年，“中产阶层”的房产就会变成“负资产”（所欠房贷大于房屋所值）。那时，“中产”返贫变“中惨”，就可能成为社会现实了。\n\n（文章只代表特约评论员个人的立场和观点）",

去年有6个省份居民人均可支配收入超过5万元，其中上海、北京居民人均可支配收入均超过了8.5万元。 \n\n国家统计局网站21日公布31个省份2024年居民人均可支配收入情况。数据显示，去年有6个省份居民人均可支配收入超过了5万元。\n\n国家统计局近日发布的数据显示，2024年全国居民人均可支配收入41314元，比上年名义增长5.3%，扣除价格因素，实际增长5.1%。分城乡看，城镇居民人均可支配收入54188元，比上年名义增长4.6%，扣除价格因素，实际增长4.4%；农村居民人均可支配收入23119元，比上年名义增长6.6%，扣除价格因素，实际增长6.3%。\n\n分省份来看，去年有6个省份居民人均可支配收入超过5万元，其中上海、北京居民人均可支配收入均超过了8.5万元。2024年，上海居民人均可支配收入88366元，位居第一。北京以85415元紧随其后。整体来看，其他省份与上海、北京均有较大差距。\n\n![Image

最新公布！31省份人均可支配收入](https://imgm.gmw.cn/attachement/jpg/site215/20250122/782981957183321327.jpg)\n\n31个省份2024年居民人均可支配收入。数据来源：国家统计局\n\n整体来看，上海和北京作为城市经济体，城镇化率高，新兴产业、高新技术产业、现代服务业等十分发达，总部经济突出，高薪岗位多，吸引了大量人才集聚，居民的平均收入也高。比如，近年来，我国收入最高的三个行业分别是信息传输、软件和信息技术服务业，金融业，科学研究和技术服务业，京沪是这些高收入行业最集中的地区。\n\n对2024年北京居民收入情况解读时，北京市统计局网站1月21日刊发的文章分析称，工资性收入是居民收入增长的主要因素。全市出台一系列稳就业、促增收举措，居民人均工资性收入54670元，同比增长5.9%，拉动居民人均可支配收入上涨3.7个百分点。\n\n浙江2024年居民人均可支配收入为67013元，位居第三。浙江省统计局发布的2024年浙江经济运行情况显示，城乡收入差距继续缩小。全体居民人均可支配收入67013元，比全国平均水平（41314元）高25699元，比上年名义增长5.0%。其中，城镇、农村居民人均可支配收入分别为78251元和42786元，分别增长4.3%和6.1%。城乡居民人均收入倍差1.83，比上年缩小0.03。\n\n浙江之后，去年人均可支配收入处于5万元梯队的有江苏、天津和广东三个省份。福建、山东、内蒙古和辽宁去年居民人均可支配收入分列7到10位。内蒙古、重庆、湖南、湖北、安徽居民人均可支配收入在中西部地区位居前五，这些省份也是中西部工业化和城镇化水平较高的地区。\n\n综合自国家统计局、第一财经\n\n
