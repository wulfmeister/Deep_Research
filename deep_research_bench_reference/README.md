## 📖 Overview

DeepResearch Bench addresses the absence of a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating Deep Research Agents (DRAs). Our benchmark consists of **100 PhD-level research tasks**, each meticulously crafted by domain experts across **22 distinct fields**, including:

* 🔬 **Science & Technology**: Physics, chemistry, biology, environmental science, and engineering
* 💼 **Finance & Business**: investments, personal finance, marketing, and human resources
* 💻 **Software**: Topics related to the use of software and the internet
* 🌍 **Others**: Art & Design, Entertainment, History, Industrial, Transportation, Travel, and more


## Benchmark Construction

### Topic Distribution Analysis

To ensure DeepResearch Bench reflects real-world research demands, we analyzed **96,147 anonymized user queries** from web search-enabled LLM interactions.These queries were classified into **22 topic domains** based on the WebOrganizer taxonomy, revealing the authentic distribution of human deep research needs across different fields.

### Expert Task Collection

Guided by real-world demand distribution, we invited **PhD-level experts and senior practitioners** (5+ years experience) to design challenging research tasks within their domains. Each submission underwent rigorous manual screening for:

- **Quality**: High research standards and complexity
- **Clarity**: Clear task definitions and requirements  
- **Authenticity**: Grounded in real research scenarios
- **Challenge Level**: Testing upper limits of DRA capabilities

This process yielded **100 high-quality benchmark tasks** (50 Chinese, 50 English) that maintain the same topical balance as observed in real-world usage.


## Evaluation Framework

![Framework Overview](pics/framework.png)

DeepResearch Bench introduces two complementary evaluation methodologies designed to comprehensively assess Deep Research Agents:

### 🎯 RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation)

RACE evaluates **report generation quality** through a sophisticated multi-step process:

- **Dynamic Criteria Generation**: Automatically generates task-specific evaluation criteria across four key dimensions:
  - 📚 **Comprehensiveness**: Coverage breadth and depth of the research topic
  - 🔍 **Insight/Depth**: Quality of analysis and insight generation  
  - 📋 **Instruction-Following**: Adherence to specific task requirements
  - 📖 **Readability**: Clarity, organization, and presentation quality

- **Reference-Based Scoring**: Compares target reports against high-quality reference reports to ensure discriminative evaluation
- **Weighted Assessment**: Uses dynamic weights adapted to each task's specific requirements

### 🔗 FACT (Framework for Factual Abundance and Citation Trustworthiness)

FACT evaluates **information retrieval and grounding capabilities** through:

- **Statement-URL Extraction**: Automatically extracts factual claims and their cited sources from generated reports
- **Deduplication**: Removes redundant statement-URL pairs to focus on unique factual claims
- **Support Verification**: Uses web scraping and LLM judgment to verify whether cited sources actually support the claims
- **Citation Metrics**: Calculates:
  - **Citation Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly supported citations
  - **Effective Citations**: Average number of verifiably supported citations per task

## 🛠️ Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Gemini API key (for LLM evaluation)
- Jina API key (for web scraping in FACT evaluation)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep_research_bench.git
cd deep_research_bench
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API Configuration

Set the required API keys as environment variables:

```bash
# Set Gemini API key for LLM evaluation
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"

# Set Jina API key for web scraping
export JINA_API_KEY="your_jina_api_key_here"
```


## Project Structure

├── data/
│   ├── criteria_data/      # Evaluation criteria data
│   ├── prompt_data/        
│   │   └── query.jsonl     # ← 100 benchmark queries for your agent
│   └── test_data/          
│       ├── cleaned_data/   # Cleaned article data

├── deepresearch_bench_race.py  # RACE evaluation script
├── run_benchmark.sh        # ← Add your model names here, then run
└── requirements.txt        # Dependencies
```

**Quick Start Flow:**
1. Use queries from `data/prompt_data/query.jsonl` → Run your Deep Research Agent
2. Save outputs to `data/test_data/raw_data/<model_name>.jsonl`
3. Add model name to `TARGET_MODELS` in `run_benchmark.sh`
4. Run: `bash run_benchmark.sh`

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Your Model Data

Run your Deep Research Agent on the benchmark queries and save outputs in the required format:

**Input**: Use queries from `data/prompt_data/query.jsonl` (100 benchmark tasks)

**Output**: Save results to `data/test_data/raw_data/<model_name>.jsonl`

**Required format** (each line should contain):
```json
{
    "id": "task_id", 
    "prompt": "original_query_text", 
    "article": "generated_research_article_with_citations"
}
```

### 2. Configure Models to Evaluate

Edit `run_benchmark.sh` and add your model name:
```bash
TARGET_MODELS=("your-model-name")
```

### 3. Run Evaluation

```bash
bash run_benchmark.sh
```

Results will be saved to:
- RACE evaluation: `results/race/<model_name>/race_result.txt`
- FACT evaluation: `results/fact/<model_name>/fact_result.txt`

### Custom LLM Integration

If you're not using the official Gemini API or want to use other LLMs for evaluation, modify the `AIClient` class in `utils/api.py` to implement your custom LLM interface.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to express our gratitude to the following contributors who helped us collect evaluation data. Since many models and agents do not provide public APIs, manual data collection was necessary, and we deeply appreciate their dedicated efforts:

**Xin Yang**, **Jie Yang**, **Yawen Li**, **Xinyu Ouyang**, **Jiaqi He**, **Gefan Zhang**, **Jinfu Liao**, **Qiuyue Chen**, **Yulin Wang**, and **Lina Wang**.

Their contributions were essential to the comprehensive evaluation presented in this benchmark.
